# Ideas for Enhancing small-world

A running list of enhancement ideas for the Three.js terrarium. Each idea is tagged with rough scope (S/M/L) and notes about which parts of `main.js` it would touch. All ideas should respect the project's **cute / rounded / painterly / soft-motion** vibe — see `CLAUDE.md` § Vibe.

## World Generation

- **Caves / arches** (L) — carve negative-space holes through the island using a third noise field with a CSG-style threshold. Probably needs a marching-cubes pass instead of `PlaneGeometry` — large change, save for later.
- **Procedural island name** (S) — generate a two-syllable name ("Mossbrim", "Velin", "Quillhollow") from the seed and show it under the biome label in the HUD. Pure flavor, deterministic. Touches `src/world.js` + `index.html`.
- **Hidden landmarks** (M) — 1-in-N chance per world of spawning a single tiny set piece (stone arch, tilted obelisk, mushroom ring, bird's nest with eggs) at a chosen `pickGroundPoint`. Surface "found: <thing>" in the HUD. New module `src/landmarks.js`.
- **Footpaths** (M) — when a creature is followed for a while, leave a faint worn dirt path along its trace by tinting the underlying terrain colors. Touches `src/fauna.js` + `src/terrain.js`.

## Creatures & Behavior

- **Look-at-camera** (S) — when the user hovers/taps a creature, it briefly rotates its head/body to face the camera with a soft ease. Already have raycaster picking in follow mode — reuse it. Touches `src/ui.js` + `src/fauna.js`.
- **Sleep cycle** (M) — at high night-factor, creatures slow, settle on the ground, and emit a faint `zZz` sprite. Wake on dawn. Tie into `updateDayNight`. Touches `src/fauna.js` + `src/world.js`.
- **Herding / flocking on the ground** (M) — give same-color creatures a mild attractor to each other (capped) so they sometimes cluster into pairs/trios. Subtle — not a full boids rewrite. Touches `src/fauna.js`.
- **Curiosity hop** (S) — creatures occasionally do a small vertical hop when a butterfly or bee passes nearby. Touches `src/fauna.js`.
- **Personality stamp per creature** (S) — at spawn, pick one of {shy, bold, sleepy, bouncy} from the deterministic RNG; tweak speed/idle/bob constants per personality. Touches `src/fauna.js`.

## Weather & Atmosphere

- **Passing storm** (M) — occasionally drift a darker cloud across the island that casts a soft ground shadow, briefly intensifies fog, and triggers rain particles if biome allows. Touches `src/sky.js` + `src/environment.js`.
- **Rainbow after rain** (S) — when a rain biome's storm ends, fade in a thin arc rainbow ring opposite the sun for ~10s. Pure shader/sprite. Touches `src/sky.js`.
- **Snow accumulation** (M) — for cold biomes, gradually whiten the top of terrain vertices facing up while snow particles play; reset on regenerate. Touches `src/environment.js` + `src/terrain.js`.
- **Petals & pollen drift** (S) — meadow/bloom biomes get a slow horizontal pollen drift layer (cheap point sprites) alongside existing particles. Touches `src/environment.js` + `src/biomes.js`.
- **Wind direction indicator** (S) — sway and cloud drift already exist; expose the shared wind vector and add a tiny compass-style chevron in the HUD that rotates with it. Touches `src/state.js` + `src/ui.js`.

## Audio

- **Ambient bed per biome** (S) — soft loop chosen by biome id (wind, rustle, drips, crackle). One `<audio>` element, crossfade on regenerate. Mute toggle in HUD.
- **Creature chirps** (S) — occasional very-soft pitched blip when a creature transitions states. Web Audio API, tiny `OscillatorNode` envelope, no samples needed.
- **Wind-chime ping on landmark discover** (S) — single soft chime when a hidden landmark first becomes visible after regenerate. Web Audio. Depends on **Hidden landmarks**.

## UI / HUD / Photo

- **Time-of-day scrubber** (S) — replace the existing `manualDayFactor` slider with a labeled 0–24h scrubber and a small sun/moon glyph that tracks it. Touches `src/ui.js`.
- **Postcard export** (S) — extend photo mode's PNG save to compose biome name + seed + date in the corner with the existing eyebrow font before download. Touches `src/ui.js`.
- **Photo gallery** (M) — when a photo is saved, also stash a thumbnail + seed in `localStorage` (cap N entries, FIFO). Add a "Gallery" panel that lists thumbnails — click reloads the seed. Touches `src/ui.js` + `index.html` + `style.css`.
- **Cinematic auto-tour** (M) — toggleable mode that slowly orbits the island, occasionally cutting to a follow on a random creature for a few seconds, then back. Reuses follow + orbit machinery. Touches `src/ui.js`.
- **Discovery log** (S) — track which biomes the user has seen across sessions in `localStorage`; show a `N/12 biomes discovered` badge in the help panel with locked silhouettes for the rest. Touches `src/ui.js`.

## Rendering / Visual Polish

- **Tilt-shift miniature look** (M) — optional post-processing toggle that adds depth-of-field blur above/below a central focus band, leaning into the terrarium feeling. Three.js `EffectComposer` from CDN, gated behind a HUD checkbox; respects `LOWFX`. Touches `main.js` + `src/ui.js`.
- **Bloom on glow elements** (S) — selective bloom for `glowFlowers`/`glowEyes` biomes (also via `EffectComposer`). Same gating as tilt-shift. Touches `main.js`.
- **Soft creature shadows** (S) — fake circular ground shadow under each creature (a downward-projected dark disc instanced mesh) — cheaper than real shadow maps and reads cuter. Touches `src/fauna.js`.
- **Water reflections of sky** (M) — for `water` biomes, add a low-res `WebGLRenderTarget` reflecting the sky dome + sun into the water plane material. Touches `src/environment.js`.
- **Subtle parallax mountains** (S) — push the existing mountain ring slightly with camera azimuth so it feels like it's farther away than the islands. Touches `src/sky.js`.

## Stretch / Big Swings

- **Seasonal overlay** (L) — each biome has a `spring/summer/autumn/winter` palette delta; URL `?season=` (or auto from real-world date) tints flora and ground.
- **Save & share full snapshots** (M) — export the current scene state (seed + camera + season + time-of-day) as a compact URL fragment, not just the seed.
- **Two-island composition** (L) — render two islands side-by-side from two seeds for comparison or storytelling.
- **Tiny narrative cards** (M) — a one-sentence procedurally-generated "what's happening here" caption per world, seeded from the same RNG. Pure flavor text.
- **Sandbox mode** (L) — a `?sandbox=1` HUD panel that lets the user override individual biome knobs (creature count, fog, water on/off, flora kinds) on top of the chosen seed. Touches `src/ui.js` + `src/world.js`.
- **Secret seeds** (S) — a small lookup table mapping a handful of cute seeds (e.g. `0xC0FE`, `0xBEEF`) to easter-egg combinations: tuned biome + camera + extra landmark. Touches `src/seed.js` + `src/world.js`.

_Conventions reminder for any of the above: no build step, no npm. New libraries (if truly needed) go through the importmap in `index.html`. Determinism-sensitive code must run synchronously inside `generateWorld` before `Math.random` is restored._
